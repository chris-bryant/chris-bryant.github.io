Swallow the Sky formed in 2014 in northeast Tennessee, with Josh Basham as guitarist, Michael Peck on bass and synths, and Chris Bryant on drums.
Since its inception, the band has shared the stage with numerous notable acts, including Mondo Generator, Interarma, Today is the Day, Lazer/Wulf, and Waft. The band's first release was a self-titled five song EP released in early 2015, which is entirely free on Bandcamp. A full length record is currently in progress.
