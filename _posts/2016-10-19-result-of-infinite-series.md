After months of tracking, more months of mixing and mastering, and a few more months of mastering at Blackbird Studios in Nashville,
we are proud to announce that Result of Infinite Series has finally been released. From the crushing guitars to the album art,
we couldn't be happier with the end product. Digital copies are available on Google Play, iTunes, Bandcamp, and Spotify. Physical
copies will be here soon.
