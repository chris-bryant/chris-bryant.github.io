As the mastering on the full length album Result of Infinite Series draws to a close, we offer this glimpse into the beginning of Swallow the Sky. We See You For What You Are is a collection of oddities and demos from the very early days of Swallow the Sky, manipulated and interspersed with soundscapes created by our very own Michael Peck. Listen for free on Bandcamp, or name your own price.
